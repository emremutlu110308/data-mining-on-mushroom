1. This project include three data mining algorithm for the mushroom dataset.
2. dt stands for decision tree, knn stands for K Nearest Neighbor, nb stands for naive bayes
3. The input data are all the same for the three algorithm. The are randomized first and then pre process to different format for these algorithm
4. Some calculations has been done on excel to facilitate the computation of some algorithm
5. There are a detailed ReadMe.txt file in each package specify instruction to run corresponding algorithm
